# Binaries
To simplify insllation of some dependencies we build some needed binaries
## Building shairport-sync and spotifyd
Run the script `generate_bins.bash` on a linux machine, making sure to `export RPI_IP_ADDRESS=pi@amplipi.local`. This will build the binaries and copy them into this directory.
