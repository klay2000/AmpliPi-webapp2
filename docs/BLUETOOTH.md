# Bluetooth
AmpliPi currently supports one bluetooth stream. When AmpliPi powers up, it will create a bluetooth stream if a bluetooth dongle is detected. AmpliPi ships with drivers pre-installed for [this bluetooth dongle](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LVH5BCP/). Other bluetooth dongles may need drivers to be installed.

The AmpliPi bluetooth name will be the same as the host name (defaults to amplipi). Connect to this with a bluetooth sound source and select the bluetooth stream on any source. You should now be able to play audio from the device and control it through the media controls on the stream interface.
